The system has been revealed through observations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the ground-based TRAPPIST (TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope) telescope, as well as other ground-based observatories. The system was named for the TRAPPIST telescope.  The seven planets of TRAPPIST-1 are all Earth-sized and terrestrial, according to research published in 2017 in the journal Nature. TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool dwarf star in the constellation Aquarius, and its planets orbit very close to it.  They are likely all tidally locked, meaning the same face of the planet is always pointed at the star, as the same side of our moon is always pointed at Earth. This creates a perpetual night side and perpetual day side on each planet.  TRAPPIST-1b and c receive the most light from the star and would be the warmest. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g all orbit in the habitable zone, the area where liquid water is most likely to be detected. But any of the planets could potentially harbor liquid water, depending on their compositions.  In the imagined planets shown here, TRAPPIST-1b is shown as a larger analogue to Jupiter's moon Io. TRAPPIST-1d is depicted with a narrow band of water near the terminator, the divide between a hot, dry day and an ice-covered night side. TRAPPIST-1e and TRAPPIST-1f are both shown covered in water, but with progressively larger ice caps on the night side. TRAPPIST-1g is portrayed with an atmosphere like Neptune's, although it is still a rocky world. TRAPPIST-1h, the farthest from the star, would be the coldest. It is portrayed here as an icy world, similar to Jupiter's moon Europa, but the least is known about it.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21422"", ""keywords"": [""Spitzer Space Telescope"", ""Trappist-1""], ""nasa_id"": ""PIA21422""}], ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA21422/collection.json""}, {""links"": [{""render"": ""image"", ""rel"": ""preview"", ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA17303/PIA17303~thumb.jpg""}], ""data"": [{""center"": ""JPL"", ""media_type"": ""image"", ""title"": ""Inner Planets Diagram"", ""date_created"": ""2008-08-19T23:00:00Z"", ""description"": ""This diagram shows the approximate distances of the terrestrial planets from the Sun; they include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars."", ""nasa_id"": ""PIA17303""}], ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA17303/collection.json""}, {""links"": [{""rel"": ""captions"", ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/video/48_WinterPlanets/48_WinterPlanets.srt""}], ""data"": [{""center"": ""HQ"", ""media_type"": ""video"", ""title"": ""ScienceCast 48: An Alignment of Planets"", ""album"": ""NASA ScienceCasts"", ""date_created"": ""2012-02-16T00:00:00Z"", ""description"": ""The brightest planets in the night sky are aligning for a must-see show in late February and March 2012.

These planets would be around the mass of Neptune, or lighter, and would orbit close to their stars, basking in their searing heat. According to the new theory, radiation from the stars would boil off hydrogen in the planets' atmospheres. Both hydrogen and helium are common ingredients of gas planets like these. Hydrogen is lighter than helium and thus more likely to escape.  After billions of years of losing hydrogen, the planet's atmosphere would become enriched with helium. Scientists predict the planets would appear covered in white or gray clouds.  This is in contrast to our own Neptune, which is blue due to the presence of methane. Methane absorbs the color red, leaving blue. Neptune is far from our sun and hasn't lost its hydrogen. The hydrogen bonds with carbon to form methane.  This artist's concept depicts a proposed helium-atmosphere planet called GJ 436b, which was found by Spitzer to lack in methane -- a first clue about its lack of hydrogen. The planet orbits every 2.6 days around its star, which is cooler than our sun and thus appears more yellow-orange in color.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19344"", ""keywords"": [""Spitzer Space Telescope"", ""artist concept""], ""nasa_id"": ""PIA19344""}], ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA19344/collection.json""}, {""links"": [{""render"": ""image"", ""rel"": ""preview"", ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA18926/PIA18926~thumb.jpg""}], ""data"": [{""center"": ""JPL"", ""media_type"": ""image"", ""title"": ""Planet With Four Stars Artist Concept"", ""date_created"": ""2015-03-04T16:53:01Z"", ""description"": ""This artist conception shows the 30 Ari system, which includes four stars and a planet.

NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope found tentative evidence for one such planet around a dead star, or white dwarf, called PG 0010+280 (depicted as white dot in illustration).  When planets are young, they are warm and toasty due to internal heat left over from their formation. Planets cool over time -- until they are possibly rejuvenated.  The theory goes that this Jupiter-like planet, which orbits far from its star, would accumulate some of the material sloughed off by its star as the star was dying. The material would cause the planet to swell in mass. As the material fell onto the planet, it would heat up due to friction and glow with infrared light.  The final result would be an old planet, billions of years in age, radiating infrared light as it did in its youth.  Spitzer detected an excess infrared light around the white dwarf PG 0010+280. Astronomers aren't sure where the light is coming from, but one possibility is a rejuvenated planet. Future observations may help solve the mystery.  A Jupiter-like planet is about ten times the size of a white dwarf.

Over 21 days, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope measured the drop in light as each planet passed in front of the star. Spitzer was able to identify a total of seven rocky worlds, including three in the habitable zone where life is possible. The study established the planets' size, distance from their sun and, for some of them, their approximate mass and density. It also established that some, if not all, these planets are tidally locked, meaning one face of the planet permanently faces their sun.  The planets appear in the order of innermost to outermost planets.  These artist's concepts were designed as follows: TRAPPIST-1b, closest to the star, was modeled on Jupiter's moon Io, which has volcanic features due to strong gravitational tugs. TRAPPIST-1c is shown as a rocky, warm world with a small ice cap on the side that never faces the star. TRAPPSIT-1d is rocky and has water only in a thin band along the terminator, dividing the day side and night side.  TRAPPIST-1e and TRAPPIST-1f are both shown covered in water, but with progressively larger ice caps on the night side. TRAPPIST-1g is portrayed with an atmosphere like Neptune's, although it is still a rocky world. The farthest planet, TRAPPIST-1h, is shown as covered in ice, similar to Jupiter's icy moon Europa.  The background stars are what you would see if you were in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Orion passes behind the planets, recognizable but distorted from what we're familiar with, in addition to Taurus and Pleiades.

A NASA Discovery mission, Kepler is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine how many of the billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets. Kepler will hunt for planets using a specialized one-meter diameter telescope called a photometer to measure the small changes in brightness caused by the transits.  Results from this mission will allow us to place our solar system within the continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy.

Two of these planets are too hot to support life as we know it, but two are in the star's \""habitable\"" zone, where liquid water could exist on the surface. These small, rocky worlds are far closer to their star than Mercury is to our sun. But because the star is smaller and cooler than ours, its habitable zone is much closer.

This closer planet is likely about 10 percent warmer than Earth.

A NASA Discovery mission, Kepler is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine how many of the billions of stars in our galaxy have such planets. Kepler will hunt for planets using a specialized one-meter diameter telescope called a photometer to measure the small changes in brightness caused by the transits.  Results from this mission will allow us to place our solar system within the continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy. After processing at Astrotech, Kepler will be carried to its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. NASA's planet-hunting Kepler mission is scheduled to launch no earlier than March 5 atop a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket.

Initially, the young disk is bright and thick with dust, providing raw materials for building planets. In the first 10 million years or so, gaps appear within the disk as newborn planets coalesce out of the dust, clearing out a path.  In time, this planetary \""debris disk\"" thins out as gravitational interactions with numerous planets slowly sweep away the dust. Steady pressure from the starlight and solar winds also blows out the dust. After a few billion years, only a thin ring remains in the outermost reaches of the system, a faint echo of the once-brilliant disk.  Our own solar system has a similar debris disk -- a ring of comets called the Kuiper Belt. Leftover dust in the inner portion of the solar system is known as \""zodiacal dust.\""  Bright, young disks can be imaged directly by visible-light telescopes, such as NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Older, fainter debris disks can be detected only by infrared telescopes like NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which sense the disks' dim heat.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07099"", ""media_type"": ""image"", ""nasa_id"": ""PIA07099""}], ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA07099/collection.json""}, {""links"": [{""render"": ""image"", ""rel"": ""preview"", ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA09931/PIA09931~thumb.jpg""}], ""data"": [{""center"": ""JPL"", ""keywords"": [""Spitzer Space Telescope""], ""title"": ""Birth of an Earth-like Planet Artist Xoncept"", ""date_created"": ""2007-10-03T14:36:09Z"", ""description"": ""This artist conception shows a binary-star, or two-star, system, called HD 113766, where astronomers suspect a rocky Earth-like planet is forming around one of the stars."", ""media_type"": ""image"", ""nasa_id"": ""PIA09931""}], ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA09931/collection.json""}, {""links"": [{""render"": ""image"", ""rel"": ""preview"", ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA09956/PIA09956~thumb.jpg""}], ""data"": [{""center"": ""JPL"", ""keywords"": [""CL0958+4702"", ""Spitzer Space Telescope""], ""title"": ""Fantastic Four Galaxies with Planet Artist Concept"", ""date_created"": ""2007-08-06T17:12:39Z"", ""description"": ""This artist concept shows what the night sky might look like from a hypothetical planet around a star tossed out of an ongoing four-way collision between big galaxies."", ""media_type"": ""image"", ""nasa_id"": ""PIA09956""}], ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA09956/collection.json""}, {""links"": [{""render"": ""image"", ""rel"": ""preview"", ""href"": ""https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA13994/PIA13994~thumb.jpg""}], ""data"": [{""center"": ""JPL"", ""keywords"": [""Galaxy Evolution Explorer GALEX""], ""title"": ""Planets Under a Red Sun Artist Concept"", ""date_created"": ""2011-04-08T02:00:38Z"", ""description"": ""This artist concept illustrates a young, red dwarf star surrounded by three planets.
